## Q: What do you mean by a Disney themed project?
Disney themed projects are any project that is inspired by anything the Walt Disney Company owns. So in short that means you can make projects inspired by Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar. You can even make projects inspired by divisons of the Walt Disney company such as anything for the Disney Parks, Disney Consumer Products and even the TV channels they manage such as ESPN, National Geographic and ABC. You can learn more about what Disney owns on the [Walt Disney Company](https://www.thewaltdisneycompany.com/about/#our-businesses) page.

## Q. Can I do this challenge with other coding challenges (i.e. 100 days of Code, 301 Days of Code)?
Yes! Coding challenges are great way of getting into the habit of coding projects and breaking out of the tutorials. This challenge is meant to do the same thing many of these coding challenges do only you get the opportunity to code with Disney characters.

## Q: Do I need to use a specific programming language/framework for this challenge?
Nope! You can use any languages/frameworks you like during this challenge. I recommend picking languages and frameworks that will help you be a better developer. So pick ones that you might be learning in a tutorial or working with ones that you feel like you need more practice with.

## Q: I just started learning how to code. Can I do this challenge?
Yes! This challenge is designed so anyone regardless if they are a newbie or a software engineer at Disney can do this challenge. Coding is similar to learning any skill so the more you practice, the better you will become.

## Q: I can't think of any projects to build. What should I do?
A great place to start are Free Code Camp or The Odin Project. These are two popular dev resources that include projects students can do to practice new skills they are learning. You can use these project ideas as a base then customize them to fit the Disney theme.

Another great option to help you start are other coding challenges. Challenges such as 30 Days, 30 Sites or Daily CSS Images are a great way to start building projects since these sites often come with daily prompts on what you can build each day.

Be creative and use your imagination. Do you want to try recreating the Disney Store website? Would you want to build a website for Tiana's Palace? Maybe you want to design a website for the Avengers. Perhaps you want to create an app for al's toy Barn. This is your chance to build your version of some of these projects.

## Q: I have a blog. Can I post my log entries there?
Yes! Just use the log template to help you writing your blog posts on your favorite blogging platform of choice.

## Q: I love this challenge! How can I see what other people are doing for the challenge?
